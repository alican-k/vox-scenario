# vox-scenario

My scenario code can be found in __scenario.js__

Question: When I use __e.callerid__ as callerid parameter of __callPSTN__ method, I am not able to make some of the calls. (I guess it call landline numbers but not mobile numbers)

Note: I am able to forward the incoming call to any number when I use purchased Voximplant number as callerid.
